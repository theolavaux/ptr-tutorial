=== Workflow to push feature branch to origin/master ===

=> On feature branch: add commits to index, commit them and have a clean history before checking out to master

-> Add changes to the index: to git add <files>
-> Commit changes to HEAD: git commit -m <commit_msg>

-> Alter commits as they are moved to a new branch: git rebase -i master
(-> Push the branch contents to remote repository: git push origin <feature_branch>)
-> git checkout master

=> On master: syncronize local master with upstream developements, then merge and push the feature

-> Pull latest changes using a rebase method, no fast-forward: git pull --rebase

-> Merge the new feature branch into master: git merge --no-ff <feature_branch>
(-> git branch -d <feature_branch>)
-> Push all the final changes to origin/master: git push origin master
