In the Feature Branch Workflow, the one we're using:

- Should we keep the commit on master branch from the feature branch AND the merge commit of feature into master?
  Because git merge with the -no-ff option creates two commits in the git log, the one from the feature branch plus the merge commit.
  Is that the behaviour that we want?

- If yes, should we add a tag like merge to the merge commit specifying that we want to merge the branch that we previously pushed?
  Should the second commit message be the same than the first one ?
